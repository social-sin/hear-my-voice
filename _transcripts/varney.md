"My experience in telling my story was good. In a way talking about yourself that deeply feels like a foreign concept. But in a way something about it was therapeutic. Even if it was just talking into a phone.

When others are listening and viewing my literal voice, I hope they feel a sense of normality and relatability as I feel like Iâ€™m a pretty normal person and the hardships I face are most likely ones that others deal with too, even if not verbally expressed. I believe that hearing or seeing that can give ease to the mind.

In college you are seeking a higher level of thought and want to have a say in what you make and contribute towards. And in an academic setting sometimes those emotions and thoughts are compressed by your peers. So the ability to have a voice is a powerful notion to most."
