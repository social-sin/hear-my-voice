"It was really nice, fun and interesting to be able to be apart of this experience. I hope that people can understand that being happy should not come with any sacrifices, especially if its affecting your mental health or everyday livelihood. I also think it's important for students to hear other student voices and learn from other people's challenges because it can help them learn what they want in life or any academic institution."
