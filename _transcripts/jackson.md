"I liked talking to my past self during this experience as it felt like a peptalk. I want others to understand how uplifting it can be to reflect and talk to your past self as it can be a motivation for your present self to keep moving forward. I think it's also important for student voices to be heard as they are rarely represented and heard by the institution."
