"I would say my expereince in telling my story was cathartic. I don't usually talk about myself openly and because of that I feel like I don't give myself the space and the time to think about my story. I'm still finding out who I am but the more I reflect on my experiences the more comfortable I become. In the past, I felt pressured into knowing exactly where I want to be, but as I've gotten older I've realized that it's okay to have ups and downs.

I hope others can relate to my experience. I can honestly say this is the first time, in a long time, that I was asked to reflect back on my life, so it took me a while to give voice to my inner self. I hope this hits for all the shy people out there to know you are not alone. Please take it for what it's worth. 

University life can get stressful, especially being in a place with so many people. I think it's necessary for student voices to be heard because these years are known be the most impactful for college students. If we don't feel like our voices are heard then it can stunt our ability to grow, learn, and build community with each other."
