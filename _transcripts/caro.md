"I felt in touch with the energy inside my soul and spoke with that force driving me. Community is an integral part of life and I am thankful for the opportunity to share. I hope to inspire others to connect with those around them and really feel the energy that exists within every single one of us.

I think it's important for student voices to be heard because sometimes academic institutions can become more focused on pulling in tuition money and expanding than maintaining the wellbeing of students. Representation of student voices, identities, and values is important for the reclamation of academic spaces."
