"I felt that my experience in telling my story was very laidback as I could freely express my own thoughts and emotions.

When listening and viewing my literal voice, I hope other people with a similiar situation can hear my works and apply it their own hopefully to the benefit of their lives.

I think it's important for student voices to be heard, expecially within an academic institution, because not only have student voices often been suppressed but it gives an example of real world experiences, its not what the school or some institution wants you to see or hear, its the down low of peoples experiences and their lives."
